This would be level one right before the game has started
with 4 rows and 6 columns. The player and the ball are also shown

This is the game over screen. Just a white background  and red text telling you
that you have lost the game.


[GUI Mockup 3] Game Play 1

resources/Mockups/GamePlay.png

This shows some game play dirung level one. The colors of the bricks change
to represent the number of times they have been hit with the ball. Blue means it
has not been hit, green means it has been hit once, and red means it has been 
hit twice and is about to break on the next hit.

[GUI Mockup 4] Game Play 2

This final picture shows gameplay in level four. The bricks have been mostly broken
but there are a few left on the final row. The score and remaining lives would be 
displayed in the top corner so as to not interfere with the game, but still display
useful information. 


#How Will Game Play differ?

We do not think the game play will differ that dramatically. The mockups provide
a useful, yet simple interface for the game and implimenting the game so that it
looks like the mockups will not be difficult. The color scheme is easy to 
replicate and the levels will involve placing images in the exact locations and 
coding collision detection for anything the ball could run into.
